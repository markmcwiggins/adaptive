This is a simple Django app that randomly presents a hand of cards to
the user and asks the user to pick a bridge bid.

The next release will support adaptive learning, keeping track of a user's
picks and showing them more frequently problems that they failed to get correct
in previous sessions.

If you want to try this, it's deployed at:
